This is the beginning of the first project from TOP.
By following the steps in TOP to get this point I have demonstrated a basic
understanding of using Linux terminal, Git, and Github. I hope by the end
of this project I will be able to demonstrate the necessary skills to be a
valuable fullstack developer.
